        <p class="link">I'm a journalist with 15 years of experience writing about and editing politics, criminal justice and foreign affairs, including at NPR, The Texas Tribune, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> and the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> â€” and now as a senior data and graphics editor at CNN.

        <p class="link">My work involves storytelling with data, code and visuals, typically with Python and Pandas. In 2012, I founded The Daily Viz, a now-retired site where I created and curated charts, maps, graphs and other data stories. I also tinker with <a href="https://github.com/stiles/locations/">side</a> <a href="https://github.com/stiles/la-trees">projects</a> and teach data journalism to graduate students at USC.
