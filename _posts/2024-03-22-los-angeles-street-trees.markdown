description: I live in Los Angeles, and somehow I became obsessed with its street trees. I've collected more than 1.6 million geocoded tree locations for dozens of LA-area municipalities. I used it to publish <a href="https://jacarandamap.com">JacarandaMap.com</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/stiles/la-trees">exploration continues on Github</a>.
