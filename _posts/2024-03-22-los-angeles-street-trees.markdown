description: I live in Los Angeles, and somehow I became obsessed with its street trees. I've collected more than 1.6 million geocoded tree locations for dozens of LA-area municipalities. I'm not quite sure what to do with them yet, but the <a href="https://github.com/stiles/la-trees">exploration continues on Github</a>.
